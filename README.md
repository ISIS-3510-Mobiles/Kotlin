# EcoStyle: Second-Hand Fashion Marketplace App

### Selected Problem
University students, like Sarah and Emily, often aspire to make sustainable fashion choices by shopping second-hand, but they face significant challenges. Traditional second-hand shopping is time-consuming and inefficient, requiring students to search through numerous physical or unreliable online stores. They often experience frustration when items donâ€™t match their style, fit, or quality expectations. Selling clothes is also inconvenient due to awkward social interactions and a lack of trustworthy platforms. The absence of a seamless, community-driven solution prevents students from effortlessly engaging in eco-friendly fashion practices.
